# Basic Particle Sim

This repository contains the code for a very basic random walk particle simulator I put together.

In its current iteration, it is meant to simulate particles moving across a tube and "sticking" to a wall. A drift is applied to the orange particles, and the populations of the orange and blue particles are graphed as a crude Monte Carlo simulation.
