# Basic Particle Sim

This repository contains the code for a very basic random walk particle simulator I put together. The code is in "main.py".

In its current iteration, it is meant to simulate particles moving across a tube and "sticking" to a wall. A drift is applied to the orange particles, and the populations of the orange and blue particles are graphed as a crude Monte Carlo simulation. The drift is programmed as a vector field and can be manually updated. The random walk and iteration parameters can also be adjusted.

Output files are about 20-30mb. Here is a splice of a gif of the program with a linear drift in the +x direction:
